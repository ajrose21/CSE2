//Roulette Java Program
//Program Should:
//  use random Math.random()) to simulate this personâ€™s betting on 100 spins
//  run the simulation 1000 times; collect data on the outcome
//  compute the number of times the number never comes up
//  compute the number of times they walk away with a profit 
//  compute total winnings

//first compile the program
//  javac Roulette.java
//run the program
//  java Roulette
